Create a professional Android app feature for a classifieds app using Supabase authentication. 

The app currently logs users in, but they are automatically logged out immediately after login. Fix this issue so that:

================================
GOAL
================================
- Users can log in with email/password or social login.
- The app keeps the user logged in even after closing or restarting the app.
- Logout only occurs when the user presses the "Logout" button.

================================
LOGIN FLOW
================================
1. User enters email and password.
2. App sends login request to Supabase Auth.
3. If login succeeds, the session is saved securely in local storage / shared preferences.
4. App checks session on app start:
   - If a valid session exists → go directly to feed.
   - If no session → show login screen.

================================
SESSION MANAGEMENT
================================
- Ensure the Supabase session (access token and refresh token) is persisted locally.
- Do not clear local storage or shared preferences on app start.
- Automatically refresh session if needed using Supabase refresh token.
- After logout, remove session from local storage.

================================
USER EXPERIENCE
================================
- User sees feed immediately after login if session is valid.
- User stays logged in between app restarts.
- Logout button explicitly logs the user out and clears session.

================================
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================
- Flutter / FlutterFlow:
  • Use supabase.auth.currentSession to check if user is logged in.
  • On login success, Supabase SDK automatically stores the session.
  • On app startup, verify currentSession to route user.
- Web / React Native:
  • Use localStorage/sessionStorage to store Supabase session.
  • Validate session on page load to auto-login.

================================
FINAL GOAL
================================
- Permanent login until user logs out manually.
- Prevent automatic logout.
- Smooth and professional user experience.
